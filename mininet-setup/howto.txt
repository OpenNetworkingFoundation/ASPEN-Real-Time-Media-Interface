The mininet script configures the VTN topology and queues automatically. 
Also you can specify the topology configuration using the input file topo_config. 
With this file you can specify the number of edge switches (giving the name is equal
to assigning dpid; For example s2 will get the dpid 0000-0000-0000-0002). Also you can 
specify the number of hosts that are connected to each switch and whether the link 
with the core of the network is limited and with how much bandwidth. Furthermore you 
have the flexibility to define the list of ports that you want to be mapped in the vtn 
topology . Note that you have to run the topology with –file argument to take into 
consideration the specified ports.

Uses multiple SDN controllers. The switches at the endpoints are connected to 
VTN-enabled Controller (ODL in this case check defined ip address). To run the 
topology you have to specify an argument that will define if the VTN creation should 
take into account all the hosts or the hosts that are connected to the switch ports 
that are specified in the topo config file (arguments –all and --file).
